                               JavaScript is a cross-platform,object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.Inside a host enviroment<br>(for example,a web browser) ,JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its enviroment to provide progrmmatic control over</br>
                            <br>them
                            <br> JavaScript contains a standard library of objects. such as Array,Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as</br>
                            <br> operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposeby supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</br>
                            </p>
                            <ul class="main">
                                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object<br> Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond</br> 
                                    <br>to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</br></li>
                                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to <br>running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an </br>
                                    application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from</br>
                                <br> one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a </br><br>server.</br></li>

                                JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The 
                                <br> JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type </br> <br>checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic </br>
                             </br><br> control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript</br>
                            </p>
                            <p class="main">
                                In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a </br><br>runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and</br>
                              <br> string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common</br><br>class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, </br>
                              <br>what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any</br><br> special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely</br>
                              <br>type methods.</br>
                            </p>

                                JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all <br>variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are</br>
                                <br>public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, <br>parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

                                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, <br>called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                            </p>
                            <p class="main">
                                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent <br>characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the 
                                <br>characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).

                                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use <br>the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names 
                                <br>are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

                                You can declare a variable in three ways:
                            </p>
                            <p class="main">
                                With the keyword var. For example,
                            </p>
                            <p class="main">
                                var x = 42.

                            <p class="main">
                                This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                            </p>
                            <p class="main">
                                By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                                <br>x = 42.
                            </p>

                                This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't
                                <br>use this variant.
                            </p>

                                With the keyword let. For example,

                                This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.

                                When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is <br>available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a 
                                <br>function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.
                            </p>
                            <p class="main">
                                JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable <br>declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For 
                                <br>example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) <br>within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.
                            </p>
                            <p class="main">

                                This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.

                                Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is<br> window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.

                                Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another<br> window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called
                                <br>phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as<br> parent.phoneNumber.

                                You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant<br> identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar
                                <br>sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.

                                A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is

                                The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const

                                        <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                                        <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive,<br> null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>

                                Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful<br> functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in
                                <br> the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as<br> procedures that your application can perform.

                                Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else
                                <br> clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
                            </p>
                            <p class="main">
                                if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }
                            </p>
                            <p class="main">
                                condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation<br> of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed;
                                <br> otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,<br> including further nested if statements.
                            </p>
                            <p class="main">
                                You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in
                                <br> sequence, as follows:
                            </p>
                            <p class="main">
                                if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
                                <br>} else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }                                
                            </p>
                            <p class="main">
                                In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be<br> executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
                                <br> general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if<br> statements:
                                <br>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                                <br>statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                                <br>statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                                <br>statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }
                                <br>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the<br> assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not 
                                <br>use the following code:
                                <br>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }
                                <br>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put<br> additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
                                <br>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }
                            </p>

                                A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A <br>while statement looks as follows:
                               <br>while (condition) statement
                               <br>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to<br> the statement following the loop.
                               <br>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true,<br> statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
                               <br> stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
                               <br>To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.
                               <br>Example:
                               <br>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
                               <br>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; }
                               <br>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on<br> the following values:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="main">
                                <li> After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                                <li> After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                                <li> After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="main">
                                After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.

                                A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the<br> function keyword, followed by:

                                <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by <br>commas.</li>
                                <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>

                                For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
                               <br>function square(number) { return number * number; }
                               <br>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement<br> that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return
                               <br> statement specifies the value returned by the function.
                               <br>return number * number;
                                Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed<br> to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not
                                <br> reflected globally or in the calling function.
